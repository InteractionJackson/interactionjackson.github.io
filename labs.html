        <h2 class="mb-2">The challenge</h2>
        <p>
        Password Labs was born of a need to validate our ideas before we could build a business case for taking various concepts further. It just so happened the outcome of this need would go on to be utilised by product teams throughout 1Password.     
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto" width="100%"  src="imgs/1p-early.png">

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-4">Opportunity</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            The business opportunity here was to get closer to the humans using the product. They would have a mechanism that any team could utilise in order to validate their direction before shipping to production. 
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto" width="100%"  src="imgs/1p-testing.png">
        </div>
        <p class="mb-4">
            For the more engaged people using the product, they had opportunity to have direct say in our roadmap and help us shape the future of the experience. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-2">Process</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            This really was something that was sketched on a napkin during an offsite for one of the concepts we would go on to utilise labs for. 
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto" width="100%"  src="imgs/1p-ideas.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            We had a grand idea that we could distill down into a smaller version that would not be destructive to the rest of the experience. If we saw the right signals from this smaller version, we would have the green light to build upon it. 
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto" width="100%"  src="imgs/1p-ideas2.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            On the back of this small feature we were able to build out the labs experience. We already had a space in our nightly release of the app for feature flags that we could effectively take over and replace. Building on that, we refactored the experience to account for additional permissions we would need. Our feature had a place to live for a limited time while we could gather the necessary feedback. 
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex align-items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto" width="100%"  src="imgs/1p-labmock.png">
        </div>
        <p>
            That feedback was gathered in two ways: quantitive data was gathered through anonymous usage metrics and qualitative data was gathered through our forums. Our team was engaged with the threads in the forum in order to dig deeper into customer feedback. 
        </p>
