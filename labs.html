        <h2 class="mb-2">The challenge</h2>
        <p> 1Password was widely perceived as a password manager (fair enough , it's in the name). But the product did far more: secure file storage, payment methods, identity documents, and more.</p>
        <p>The problem was users didn't know, and the product didn't show.</p>
        <p>And even when users were aware, the mental effort of learning what else they could store often outweighed the perceived value. From a behavioural standpoint, this made sense. Security feels abstract until it's not. And digital life admin is hard to prioritise, especially when most products aren't designed to reduce friction.</p>
        <p>We needed a more human, context-aware way to surface the value of 1Password, before users churned or defaulted back to simpler tools like notes apps and screenshots.  
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-4">Framing the opportunity</h2>
        <p>
            We started with a behavioural insight:</p>
        <p>"Human brains don't run on logic any more than a horse runs on petrol."</p>
        <p>That quote (and some lovely white papers) helped us frame the real user problem: Digital security is emotionally distant, often scary, and rarely urgent, until it's too late.</p>
        <div class="flex items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto w-full" src="imgs/1p-early.png" alt="Early concepts">
        </div>
        <p>With that in mind, I used a hypothesis-led approach to align the team:</p>
        <p>🌱 Hypothesis v1:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote italic">
            <p class="mb-0">"We believe that providing more utility within 1Password using clear paradigms will motivate people to store more than just their logins. This will increase product stickiness and perceived value."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This gave us a structured way to tie user needs, business goals, and product telemetry together, which made it easier to gain leadership buy-in.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            For the more engaged people using the product, they had opportunity to have direct say in our roadmap and help us shape the future of the experience. 
        </p>
      </div>
    <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-2">Research and behavioural framing</h2>
        <p>
            We ran a series of moderated and unmoderated studies targeting new users within the first few weeks of onboarding. We explored questions like:
            <ul class="text-text-secondary">
                <li class="pb-1">What's confusing about setup?</li>
                <li class="pb-1">Why don't people store more than logins?</li>
                <li class="pb-1">When do people feel "safe" or "in control</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
            <div class="flex items-center mb-5">
                <img class="mx-auto w-full" src="imgs/1p-testing.png" alt="User testing">
            </div>
            <p>To bring in behavioural thinking, I introduced BJ Fogg's Behaviour Model to demonstrate why adding documents or IDs often failed:
            <ul class="text-text-secondary">
                <li class="pb-1">Motivation was low </li>
                <li class="pb-1">Ability was blocked by unclear UX</li>
                <li class="pb-1">Triggers didn't exist</li>
                </ul>
            </p>            
            <p>This helped us anchor the need for contextual nudges and structured guidance — not just feature exposure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-2">Designing "Spaces"</h2>
        <p> From there, we evolved the concept of "Paradigms" into what became Spaces, structured areas of the app built around real-life contexts.
            <ul class="text-text-secondary">
                    <li class="pb-1">Home</li>
                    <li class="pb-1">Travel</li>
                    <li class="pb-1">Money</li>
                    <li class="pb-1">Health</li>
                    <li class="pb-1">Personal details</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <div class="flex items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto w-full" src="imgs/1p-ideas.png" alt="Spaces concepts">
        </div>
            <p>These would act as both organisational tools and cognitive scaffolding, helping users quickly understand what else 1Password could do without needing a long onboarding flow.</p>
            <p>We created a refined hypothesis to guide this work:</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote italic">
            <p class="mb-0">""We believe that clearly defined "spaces" will help users discover and engage with 1Password's full value earlier. We'll know it's working when more users add 2+ item types and convert post-trial.""</p>
        </blockquote>

    </div>

    <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-2">Building Labs for Validation</h2>
            <p> The design was ambitious, and a significant departure from the existing app model. We needed a safe, controlled way to test this vision with real users, without disrupting the core experience.</p>
            <p>So myself and my Design Director proposed we create a Labs environment. Where teams could launch experiments and users could opt in. After some internal lobbying, we got buy-in. I partnered with our illustrator Joanna to make it feel inviting and exciting.</p>
            <p>We launched it publicly and began testing.</p>
        <div class="flex items-center mb-5">
            <img class="mx-auto w-full" src="imgs/1p-labmock.png" alt="Labs interface">

    </div>

    <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-2">Launching Real Experiments</h2>
            <p class="mb-4"> Our first test: Default Details, a precursor to the "Profile" space. It let users set default identities and cards for autofill, making value visible right away.</p>
            <p>We also snuck in OCR scanning for credit cards, a highly requested feature that reduced friction and boosted perceived utility.</p>
            <p>These early experiments gave us:
                <ul class="text-text-secondary">
                    <li class="pb-1">✅ Quantitative validation of interest</li>
                    <li class="pb-1">✅ Qualitative insight into next steps</li>
                    <li class="pb-1">✅ Internal confidence to keep going</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    </div>
        <div class="mb-5">
            <h2 class="mb-2">Impact</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
                What started as a Figjam doodle became a new direction for 1Password.
            <ul class="text-text-secondary">
                <li class="pb-1">55K+ interactions in Labs</li>
                <li class="pb-1">4 features launched</li>
                <li class="pb-1">9 experiments shipped</li>
                <li class="pb-1">1 new product team spun up to carry the work forward</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <div class="flex items-center mb-5">
                <img class="mx-auto w-full" src="imgs/1p-outcome.png" alt="Outcomes">
            </div>
            <p>The "Spaces" concept led directly into Profile, which is now live. It set the groundwork for future, more personalised user experiences across the app.</p>
