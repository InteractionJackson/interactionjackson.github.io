            <p>
              I designed the search and discovery experience at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zoopla.co.uk/">Zoopla</a>, making it easier for people to find their next home. I led the redesign of the homepage, creating clearer paths into search and exploration. I also contributed to the Zoopla Design System and supported major tech migrations, ensuring consistency and quality across the product.
